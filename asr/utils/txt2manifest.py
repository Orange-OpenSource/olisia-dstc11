    The in and out data streams are handled with manifest files which contain the paths to the wav files, their respective duration and reference transcription. 
    When we predict, it updates the manifest file with a field for predicted transcription.

    Arguments :
        - wav_path_prefix : The path where we can find all the wav files regrouped by dialogue ID folders.
        - manifest_path : The path where the manifest will be written.
        - reference_path : The path where we can find the reference text transcription. We consider it to follow the dstc11 format i.e. 
                    each line corresponds to a dialogue turn formated as "line_nr: [X] dialog_id: [Y] turn_id: [Z] text: [A] state: [B]"
